# DeathRanking

A Minecraft plugin to track and rank how many times each player has died.

The number of every death will be shown to the player. Additionally, every 50th death will be announced to the entire server. This is not configurable.

Check your death count at any time with `/deaths`. Check the scoreboard with `/deathtop [page]`.

The scoreboard cannot be modified in game; you must modify or delete the deaths file to change it.
