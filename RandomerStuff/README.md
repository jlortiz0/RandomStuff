If it isn't big enough to earn its own folder, it goes here.

- kbAttachDl.py - Downloads all attachments from a keybase team channel
- temp.py - Some strange encoder I reverse engineered a while back. Don't remember where it's from.
- entropy.go - A quick thing to get the number of bits required to represent the collective contents of the messages sent by a user in a guild. Most seem to be around lg(55).
- dumb_idea.c - A service to automatically log in to a certain network that kicks me off randomly. Created around October 2021, but no longer functional.
- songs.py - Takes a spreadsheet of YouTube URLs, downloads them as m4a, and tags the output files. It would have been less hassle to buy the album if they were still selling it, but noooooo.
