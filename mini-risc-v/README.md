# Mini RISC-V

An attempt to create an interactive 5-stage pipeline diagram with assembler for RISC-V. It started as an assembler and disassembler, but I wanted to expand it to... well, I guess I wanted it to be a mini-MARS. Clearly that didn't happen.

Anyway, the interface would have shown the lines triggered by instructions as they passed through each stage of the pipeline. The values on the lines would be shown as tooltips. I suppose there would have been an assembler and memory tab as well.

I should have just made a modification to MARS.
