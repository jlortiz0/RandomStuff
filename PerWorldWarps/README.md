# PerWorldWarps

Attempts to imitate Essentials' warp system, but has separate warps per-world. Only supports very basic usage; signs and `/warpinfo` are not implemented.

This was created as a temporary measure to prevent players from accidently warping between creative and survival worlds during a period where the method previously used to separate them broke.
