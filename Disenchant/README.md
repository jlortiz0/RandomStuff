# Disenchanter

Transfers the enchantments from a held item to a blank book for free. The intended purpose was to save cool enchantments from the grindstone without giving players access to `/repair` again.

Run `/disenchant` to disenchant the held item. You must have an unenchanted book in your inventory for the operation to succeed.
